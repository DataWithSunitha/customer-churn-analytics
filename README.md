## 📊 Project Overview

Churn (customer loss) is one of the biggest concerns in subscription-based businesses. In this project, I:

- Cleaned and prepared raw churn data
- Performed exploratory data analysis
- Engineered features and trained a logistic regression model
- Evaluated model accuracy and performance
